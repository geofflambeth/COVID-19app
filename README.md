# This is a web app using Shiny and Plotly to visualize COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins.
### This app began with a fork of Johns Hopkins CCSE COVID 19 data, which is updated manually on a regular basis to maintain accuracy of the app.

App can in browser without cloning or download [here](https://geofflambeth.shinyapps.io/COVID19app)

All files for the ShinyApp are maintained in the ShinyApp folder, while all Johns Hopkins data maintains its original file structure.

/ShinyApp/Update.R updates /ShinyApp/JohnsHopkinsAll.csv, which is pulled from /csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports.


### I am a new R user. I recognize that some of my work here may not follow best-practices, however I've used this as an exercise to begin familiarizing myself with R, data visualization, and publishing ShinyApps.

I will continue to update this project as I have time and develop new skills.
